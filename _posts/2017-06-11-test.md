    title: Mac G4 Cube
---

When I search for a classic Macintosh on eBay or Craigslist, I always try and find bundled deals. While I don’t need another Apple Keyboard or Pro Mouse cluttering my office, the bundled deal usually is a better financial option. Additionally, it is helpful to have spares of certain parts such as keyboards, mice, and even power supplies in case you ever need them to repair your primary devices should they break. 

While it is great to get used accessories in bundle deals, it is incredibly important to do a quick check of them before plugging them into your Macintosh, as evident by my rather dumb mistake. When I purchased my Mac G4 Cube on eBay, it came in a bundle with a keyboard, mouse, and to my happy surprise an Apple Studio Display. While I was excited to add a Studio Display to my collection, I was very skeptical if it worked due to how cheap the bundle was.

*Been waiting a while for this*

After the package had arrived and I unpacked all the parts, I did my usual check of the Macintosh to look for any broken ports or missing components within the computer. Forgetting my initial concern if the monitor was working, I quickly plugged it into the DVI port on the underside of the Cube and tried to turn it on. The Cube sounded its startup chime, but then instantly turned off. The monitor never lit up, but the power button on the front face of it did turn on for a quick second.

Too excited to finally have a Mac G4 Cube, something I had yearned to purchase for years, I unplugged the monitor and attached a VGA monitor. The Cube turned on and worked perfectly. After a few quick Google searches, it seemed like the problem could be the Cube’s power supply which was something I didn’t want to deal with at the time, so I set aside the monitor to deal with in the future.

Fast forward a few years when I’m unpacking my classic Macintosh collection and getting ready to start this blog. I found the monitor and tried to plug it into one of my Power Mac G4 Towers. To my surprise, it also did not boot up, similarly to the Cube. I was convinced the monitor was the issue, knowing that I kept my Power Mac in the best working order of any of my other Macintoshes. While I was ready to toss the monitor out or donate it, I did the one thing I should have done from the start, check the pins on the DVI connector.

To my surprise, the pins on the DVI connector were bent, to be exact one of the pins were bent and touching another. Both of these pins stand just a little bit taller than the rest of the pins and skirt the top of the connector’s wall. I carefully bent the pin back, hoping I wouldn’t snap it off ruining the connector, and then bent down and inspected the Power Mac’s DVI port.

Unlike a VGA port, which has fewer pins and a more stable port, a DVI port consists of a honeycomb of openings. The small walls to the DVI port are incredibly brittle, evident in the broken port I now had to try and fix. I went back and inspected the Mac G4 Cube’s DVI port, and no surprise there, the port was damaged by the monitor’s connector. Figuring if worse to comes to worse and I ruin the port while trying to fix it, I can always use the VGA port or purchase a new graphics card for both computers. Taking a set of eyeglass screwdrivers, I carefully pushed the thin wall back into place, returning the connector back to its original shape.

While the fix isn’t perfect and I’m still cautious when I plug in a DVI connector; it has been working for a few months. The monitor works perfectly, although there is a small burn-in spot on the screen. I’m happy with having an official Apple monitor which I can use for my final Macintosh Classic build. Thankfully this was an easy repair but is a great reminder to check your devices when you purchase them or pull them out of storage, hopefully catching easy to avoid issues before they bloom into a headache. For some of these computers, doing significant repairs on them could cost more than the actual computer since some parts are already becoming hard to find, looking at you Mac G4 Cube’s power supply. So try and be a bit smarter than me and hopefully avoid something as dumb as almost breaking your DVI ports.
